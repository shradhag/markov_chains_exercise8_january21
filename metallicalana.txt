New blood joins this earth,
And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules.

With time the child draws in.
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on.

He's known a vow unto his own,
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all –
This bitter man he is.

Throughout his life the same –
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win –
A tired man they see no longer cares.

The old man then prepares
To die regretfully –
That old man here is me.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

You labelled me,
I'll label you.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

You labelled me,
I'll label you.
So I dub thee unforgiven.

Never free.
Never me.
So I dub thee unforgiven

Hold me in your arms,
Love me like your best friends did,
Promise I won't hurt you kid,
Hold me really tight until the stars look big,
Never let me go.

All the world is ours,
Like they say in Scarface kid,
You can push your drugs and I can make it big,
Sing at CBGB's have a real good gig,
Hey you never know.

Cause baby we were born to live fast and die young,
Born to be bad, have fun,
Honey, you and me can be one,
Just believe, come on.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

We gonna go far,
I can already taste it kid,
LA's gonna look real good,
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big,
Never let me go.

Send me to the stars,
Tell me when I get there kid,
I can be your Nancy,
You can be my Sid,
Get into some trouble like our parents did,
Hey, they'll never know,

Cause baby we were born to be bad,
Move on,
Built to go fast,
and stay strong,
Honey, you and me and no one,
Just believe,
Come on.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

I remember when I saw you for the first time,
You were laughing,
Sparking like a new dime,
I came over,
"Hello, can you be mine?"
Can you be mine,
Can you be mine?

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Baby it's a sweet life,
Sing it like a song,
It's a short trip,
Only getting one who can count on me and my love more than anyone,
Never let me go.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.
